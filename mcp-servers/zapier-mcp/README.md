# Zapier MCP Server

**Status**: ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

This MCP server integration for Zapier is currently being developed.

## About Zapier

Zapier is an automation platform that connects different apps and services, allowing you to create automated workflows (called "Zaps") without coding.

## Planned Features

- **Zap Management**: Create, read, update, and manage Zaps
- **Trigger Execution**: Manually trigger Zaps and webhooks
- **Workflow Monitoring**: Check Zap status and execution history
- **App Integration**: Access available apps and their triggers/actions
- **Team Management**: Manage team Zaps and shared workflows
- **Webhook Management**: Create and manage webhook endpoints

## Configuration (Planned)

```bash
# Environment Variables
ZAPIER_API_KEY=your_zapier_api_key_here
ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url  # Optional for webhook operations
```

### Getting a Zapier API Key (When Available)

1. Log in to your Zapier account
2. Go to [Zapier Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com/)
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key and add it to your environment

## Usage (Coming Soon)

This server will provide tools for:

- **Zap Operations**:
  - List all user Zaps
  - Get Zap details and configuration
  - Enable/disable Zaps
  - Create new Zaps programmatically

- **Execution & Monitoring**:
  - Trigger Zaps manually
  - Check Zap execution history
  - Monitor workflow status
  - Get execution logs and errors

- **Webhook Management**:
  - Create webhook endpoints
  - Manage webhook subscriptions
  - Test webhook deliveries
  - Handle webhook responses

- **App Discovery**:
  - Browse available Zapier apps
  - Get app triggers and actions
  - Check integration compatibility

## Development Status

- [ ] Initial server implementation
- [ ] Zapier API authentication
- [ ] Zap management tools
- [ ] Webhook creation and management
- [ ] Execution monitoring
- [ ] Team workspace integration
- [ ] Error handling and logging

## API Capabilities (Planned)

Based on the Zapier Platform API, this server will support:

- **Zaps API**: CRUD operations for automation workflows
- **History API**: Access execution logs and performance data
- **Webhook API**: Manage webhook endpoints and subscriptions
- **Apps API**: Browse available integrations and capabilities

## Contributing

This server is currently under development. If you're interested in contributing or have specific Zapier integration requirements, please:

1. Review the [Zapier Platform API documentation](https://platform.zapier.com/docs/api)
2. Check existing issues for planned features  
3. Create a feature request issue describing your automation needs
4. Consider contributing to the implementation

## Installation

**Note**: This server is not yet functional. Installation instructions will be added once development is complete.

```bash
# Planned installation (not yet available)
cd mcp-servers/zapier-mcp
npm install  
node index.js --help
```

## Security Considerations

When implemented, this server will:
- Use secure API key authentication
- Respect Zapier's rate limiting policies
- Handle sensitive workflow data appropriately
- Never store or log API keys
- Follow Zapier's API terms of service
- Validate webhook signatures for security

## Use Cases

Potential applications include:
- **Workflow Automation**: Create and manage complex automation workflows
- **Integration Management**: Monitor and maintain app integrations
- **Data Synchronization**: Sync data between different platforms
- **Event-Driven Actions**: Trigger actions based on external events
- **Business Process Automation**: Streamline repetitive business tasks
- **Notification Systems**: Set up intelligent alert and notification workflows

## Webhook Features (Planned)

- **Dynamic Webhook Creation**: Generate webhooks for external integrations
- **Payload Processing**: Handle and transform webhook payloads
- **Response Management**: Send appropriate responses to webhook triggers
- **Security Validation**: Verify webhook authenticity and signatures

## Rate Limiting

The server will implement:
- Automatic rate limit handling
- Request queuing for bulk operations
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Usage monitoring and alerts

## Support

For questions about this server's development:
- Create an issue in this repository
- Tag it with `zapier-mcp` and `under-development`
- Describe your automation workflows and integration requirements
