# Figma MCP Server

**Status**: ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

This MCP server integration for Figma is currently being developed.

## About Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that runs in the browser, allowing teams to create, prototype, and collaborate on designs in real-time.

## Planned Features

- **File Management**: Access and manage Figma files and projects
- **Design Retrieval**: Extract design elements, components, and assets
- **Comments & Feedback**: Read and manage comments on designs
- **Version History**: Access file versions and revision history
- **Team Management**: Interact with team workspaces and permissions
- **Export Functionality**: Export designs in various formats

## Configuration (Planned)

```bash
# Environment Variables
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_figma_token_here
FIGMA_TEAM_ID=your_team_id  # Optional for team-specific operations
```

### Getting a Figma Token (When Available)

1. Go to Figma Account Settings
2. Navigate to "Personal access tokens"
3. Generate a new token
4. Copy the token and add it to your environment

## Usage (Coming Soon)

This server will provide tools for:

- **File Operations**:
  - List team projects and files
  - Get file metadata and version information
  - Access design components and styles

- **Design Access**:
  - Retrieve design elements and properties
  - Export images and assets
  - Access component libraries

- **Collaboration**:
  - Read comments and feedback
  - Get team member information
  - Access sharing permissions

- **Version Control**:
  - List file versions
  - Compare version changes
  - Access version timestamps

## Development Status

- [ ] Initial server implementation
- [ ] Figma API authentication
- [ ] File and project tools
- [ ] Design element extraction
- [ ] Comment and collaboration tools
- [ ] Export and asset management
- [ ] Team workspace integration

## API Capabilities (Planned)

Based on the Figma API, this server will support:

- **Files API**: Access file content, metadata, and versions
- **Comments API**: Read and manage design feedback
- **Teams API**: Access team information and projects
- **Users API**: Get user information and permissions

## Contributing

This server is currently under development. If you're interested in contributing or have specific Figma integration requirements, please:

1. Review the [Figma API documentation](https://www.figma.com/developers/api)
2. Check existing issues for planned features
3. Create a feature request issue describing your use case
4. Consider contributing to the implementation

## Installation

**Note**: This server is not yet functional. Installation instructions will be added once development is complete.

```bash
# Planned installation (not yet available)
cd mcp-servers/figma-mcp
npm install
node index.js --help
```

## Security Considerations

When implemented, this server will:
- Use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Respect Figma's rate limiting
- Handle file permissions appropriately
- Never store or log access tokens
- Follow Figma's API terms of service

## Use Cases

Potential applications include:
- **Design Documentation**: Automatically generate design system docs
- **Asset Management**: Sync design assets with development projects
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated design review and validation
- **Project Management**: Track design progress and deliverables
- **Integration Workflows**: Connect Figma with development tools

## Support

For questions about this server's development:
- Create an issue in this repository
- Tag it with `figma-mcp` and `under-development`
- Describe your Figma workflow and integration needs

**Expected Availability**: To be determined based on community interest and developer availability.

*This README will be updated as development progresses.*
